-------------------------------------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS
-------------------------------------------------------

3rd Workshop on Scripting for the Semantic Web
<A HREF="http://www.semanticscripting.org/SFSW2007/">http://www.semanticscripting.org/SFSW2007/</A>

co-located with
4th European Semantic Web Conference
June 6, 2007, Innsbruck, Austria

-------------------------------------------------------


Scripting languages such as PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Perl, JSP and 
ActionScript are playing a central role in current development towards flexible, 
lightweight web applications following the AJAX and REST design paradigms. These 
languages are the tools of a generation of web programmers who use them to 
quickly create server and client-side web applications. Many deployed Semantic 
Web applications from the FOAF, RSS/ATOM, blog and wiki communities, as well as 
many innovative mashups from the Web 2.0 and Open Data movements are using 
scripting languages and it is likely that the process of RDF-izing existing 
database-backed websites, wikis, weblogs and CMS will largely rely on scripting 
languages.

The workshop aims to bring together developers of the RDF base infrastructure 
for scripting languages with practitioners building applications using these 
languages. Last years Scripting for the Semantic Web workshop in Budva, 
Montenegro focused on giving an overview about the support for Semantic Web 
technologies within scripting languages. The special focus of this year's 
workshop is the role of scripting languages in the process of populating the Web 
with linked RDF data as well as to showcase innovative scripting applications 
that consume RDF data from the Web. The second focus of the workshop is to show 
how Web 2.0 applications and mashups can benefit from Semantic Web technologies.

The workshop will include a scripting challenge (conducted for the 2nd time) 
which will award a prize to the most innovative scripting application.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Infrastructure

* Semantic Web frameworks and APIs for scripting languages
* RDF repositories and query languages implemented using scripting languages
* Reasoning engines implemented using scripting languages
* Semantic Web publishing and data syndication frameworks
* Approaches to crawling Web data and querying distributed data on the Web

Applications

* Semantic Web applications using scripting languages
* Approaches to RDF-izing existing applications, such as RDFa and GRDDL
* Mashups that provide RDF views on Web 2.0 data sources such as Google,
  Yahoo, Amazon or eBay
* Wikis, weblogs and data syndication systems using RDF
* RDF/OWL editors and authoring environments
* Scripting applications for visualizing Web data.
* Semantic Web Mining and Social Network Analysis
* Mashups that demonstrate the novel capabilities of Semantic Web technologies

Conceptual

* Rapid development techniques for the Semantic Web
* Employment of scripting language characteristics for Semantic Web development
* Scalability and benchmarks of Semantic Web scripting applications

Scripting Challenge

The workshop includes a scripting challenge which will award a prize (an Apple 
iPod Video or alternatively  Euro 200 cash) to the most innovative small 
scripting application or mashup. The application must be implemented using a 
scripting language and Semantic Web technologies. It should access, visualize or 
combine information from different sources in new unforeseen ways. Authors of 
Scripting Challenge submissions are not required to attend the workshop 
personally. Please refer to Tom Heath for further information about the 
Scripting Challenge.
